# COMP0090CW2

This is the code for CW2 group work for Deep Learning
This code will require data to be downloaded from: https://weisslab.cs.ucl.ac.uk/WEISSTeaching/datasets/-/tree/oxpet/data_new
You will also have to change the path in the code

Code should be run in order of:

  - For original MTL Model:
    - networkaux
    - trainaux
    - networktarg
    - traintarg
    
  - For Baseline Model:
    - networkbase
    - trainbase
    
  - For Ablated MTL Model:
    - networkab
    - trainab
